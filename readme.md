## Cocode?

Cocode is a system designed for an online programming class that shows 
other learners' code editors and running output in the programming environment 
with minimum privacy issues. 

With Cocode, learners can share the social presence without any explicit action. 
their normal learning activities would be used to provide visual cues for social presence.

The demo website serves a simple Python programming exercise with Cocode.
